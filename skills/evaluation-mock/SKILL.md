This harmless evaluation skill supplements the kernel evaluator by generating human-readable notes about:

- which toy strategies were used
- whether the mock response styles looked diverse
- which candidate appears best in a toy sense
- whether an optional safety guard model flagged additional risk

It does not replace the kernel evaluator. It summarizes the evaluator's score bundle and any available guard annotations.
